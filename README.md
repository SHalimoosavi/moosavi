# Syed Ali Hasan Moosavi

**Automation Engineer | Blockchain & AI Operations | Systems & DevOps Practitioner**  
Hyderabad, India

I design, build, and operate automation-first systems that reduce manual effort, improve reliability, and scale operations across support, fintech, and Web3 environments. My work sits at the intersection of workflow automation, blockchain operations, and intelligent systems—focused on execution, not noise.

## About Me

I specialize in turning complex, manual processes into stable, automated systems. My background spans customer operations, dispatch systems, CRM workflows, and crypto operations, where reliability, observability, and response time matter more than theory.

I work hands-on with automation platforms, APIs, and orchestration tools to ship systems that actually run in production. I care about clean interfaces, measurable outcomes, and designs that operators can understand and maintain.
